## Program explanation

The ring program initializes a value from process zero, and the value is passed around every single process. The program terminates when process zero receives the value from the last process. As you can see from the program, extra care is taken to assure that it doesn't deadlock. In other words, process zero makes sure that it has completed its first send before it tries to receive the value from the last process. All of the other processes simply call `MPI_Recv` (receiving from their neighboring lower process) and then `MPI_Send` (sending the value to their neighboring higher process) to pass the value along the ring. `MPI_Send` and `MPI_Recv` will block until the message has been transmitted. Because of this, the `printfs` should occur by the order in which the value is passed.
